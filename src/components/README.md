# Components

Reusable UI components organized by category.

## Structure

- `layout/` - Layout components (Header, Footer)
- `sections/` - Page section components (Hero, About, Experience, FeaturedProjects, Contact)
- `ui/` - Base UI components (HighlightText, ThemeToggle)
- `motion/` - Animation wrapper components (FadeIn)
- `providers/` - Context providers (ThemeProvider, SmoothScrollProvider)

## Naming Conventions

- PascalCase for component files (e.g., `Header.tsx`)
- Component name should match file name
- Tests located in `__tests__/components/`
