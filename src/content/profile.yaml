about:
  heading: Backend systems that power millions of users
  intro: |
    I'm a backend developer with 10+ years in software engineering, the last 6+ focused
    exclusively on building high-throughput backend systems. From real-time broadcast
    captioning at Fox to ad analytics serving millions at Niantic, I've built systems
    where reliability isn't optional—it's the baseline.
  philosophy: |
    I believe great backend systems are invisible to users: fast, consistent, and resilient
    under load. My approach combines Python's expressiveness with TypeScript's type safety
    to build APIs and services that teams can maintain and scale with confidence.
  currentFocus: |
    Currently building real-time captioning infrastructure at Fox Corporation—distributed
    microservices handling live broadcast captions with automatic failover. I'm drawn to
    problems involving real-time data, event-driven architectures, and systems that need
    to work the first time, every time.
  coreValues:
    - reliability
    - performance
    - maintainability
