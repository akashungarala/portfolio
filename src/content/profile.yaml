about:
  heading: Backend systems that power millions of users
  intro: |
    I'm a software engineer with 9+ years building high-throughput backend systems.
    From real-time broadcast captioning serving 8M+ viewers at Fox to ad platforms
    processing 2B+ daily events at Niantic, I architect systems where reliability
    and performance are non-negotiable.
  philosophy: |
    Great backend systems are invisible to users: fast, consistent, and resilient
    under load. I combine Python's expressiveness with TypeScript's type safety
    to build services that teams can maintain and scale with confidence. I own
    problems end-to-end—from architecture to deployment to on-call.
  currentFocus: |
    Recently built CaptionExchange at Fox Corporation—a distributed microservices
    platform handling live broadcast captions with sub-5-second failover for 8M+
    concurrent viewers. I'm drawn to real-time data, event-driven architectures,
    and systems that need to work the first time, every time.
  coreValues:
    - reliability
    - ownership
    - performance
