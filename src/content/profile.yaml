about:
  heading: Systems that scale when it matters most
  intro: |
    9+ years building backend systems where failure isn't an option. Real-time
    broadcast captioning for 8M+ viewers. Ad platforms processing 2B+ daily events.
    Observability tools trusted by 50+ engineering teams. I design systems where
    uptime and throughput are non-negotiable.
  philosophy: |
    Great backend systems are invisible: fast, consistent, resilient under load.
    I combine Python's expressiveness with TypeScript's type safety to build
    services teams can maintain and scale. I own problems end-to-end — architecture,
    deployment, and on-call.
  currentFocus: |
    Recently built CaptionExchange at Fox — a distributed microservices platform
    with sub-5-second failover for live broadcasts. Drawn to real-time data,
    event-driven architectures, and systems that work the first time, every time.
  coreValues:
    - failure isn't an option
    - 8M+ viewers
    - 2B+ daily events
    - 50+ engineering teams
    - Python
    - TypeScript
    - end-to-end
    - sub-5-second failover

    description: |
      Real-time AI/human captioning platform with sub-5-second failover
      serving 8M+ concurrent broadcast viewers.
    longDescription: |
      Challenge: Fox's live broadcasts needed seamless captioning with instant
      failover between AI and human captioners — existing solutions had 3+ minute
      recovery times, unacceptable for live TV.
      
      Solution: Architected 9 microservices handling real-time audio transport,
      caption routing, and WebSocket-based session control. Built predictive
      routing that detects failures before they impact viewers.
      
      Impact: Reduced failover from 3 minutes to under 5 seconds. Platform now
      serves 8M+ concurrent viewers with sub-100ms p99 latency across 10K+
      simultaneous connections.
    techStack: [Python, FastAPI, TypeScript, Express.js, WebSockets, Kubernetes, Helm]
    featured: true
    metrics:
      - 8M+ concurrent viewers served
      - Sub-5-second failover (down from 3 minutes)

    logo: /assets/logos/fidelity.svg
    description: |
      Centralized observability platform reducing Mean Time to Detection
      by 40% across 50+ engineering teams.
    longDescription: |
      Challenge: Fidelity's 500+ microservices lacked unified reliability metrics.
      Teams couldn't track SLOs consistently, leading to slow incident detection
      and alert fatigue.

      Solution: Built end-to-end SLO platform with alerts-as-code, error budget
      tracking, and automated breach notifications. Integrated OpenTelemetry
      across all services with a React dashboard for visibility.

      Impact: Reduced Mean Time to Detection by 40% across 50+ teams. High-cardinality
      metrics POC cut alert noise by 50%, saving 20 engineering hours weekly.
    techStack: [Python, FastAPI, AWS Lambda, PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript, Terraform, OpenTelemetry]
    featured: true
    metrics:
      - 40% reduction in Mean Time to Detection
      - 50+ engineering teams onboarded
      - 20 engineering hours/week saved in alert triage

      with 99.99% uptime.
    longDescription: |
      Challenge: Pokemon GO needed a location-based ad platform that could handle
      massive scale (80M+ MAU) while delivering real-time rewards without impacting
      gameplay performance.

      Solution: Designed event-driven pipelines using Celery and Cloud Spanner.
      Optimized query patterns and indexing strategies for real-time analytics
      at scale.

      Impact: Achieved 99.99% uptime processing 2B+ daily events. Reduced p99
      latency from 800ms to 200ms for reward delivery, with 60% improvement in
      analytics query performance.
    techStack: [Python, FastAPI, TypeScript, Express.js, Cloud Spanner, Celery, GCP]
    featured: true
    metrics:
      - 99.99% uptime for 80M+ MAU

    description: |
      High-throughput identity resolution system scaling 4x while reducing
      infrastructure costs by 30%.
    longDescription: |
      Challenge: Adara's identity resolution system couldn't keep up with growing
      data volumes — stuck at 5K writes/sec with rising infrastructure costs as
      the company scaled to 200+ enterprise partners.

      Solution: Re-architected the system using Python and Cloud Pub/Sub for
      event-driven processing. Built data pipelines processing 5TB+ daily via
      BigQuery and PostgreSQL. Created reusable microservice templates.

      Impact: Scaled throughput 4x (5K to 20K+ writes/sec) while cutting infrastructure
      costs by 30%. Reduced new service bootstrap time from 2 weeks to 2 days with
      company-wide template adoption.
    techStack: [Python, Flask, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Cloud Pub/Sub, Apache Airflow, Auth0]
    featured: true
    metrics:
      - 4x throughput increase (5K to 20K+ writes/sec)
